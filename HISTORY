This program is built on and evolved from hardlink.py (or hardlinkpy), which
was originally written by John L. Villalovos (sodarock), and developed further
by Antti Kaihola, Carl Henrik Lunde, and others.

=========================================================================
 hardlink.py â€“ hardlink together identical files in order to save space.
=========================================================================

John L. Villalovos (sodarock) first wrote the code in C++ and then
decided to port it to Python.  It was later forked and copied from
Google code to GitHub by Antti Kaihola, and some modifications and
improvements were made there.

Performance is orders of magnitude faster than hardlink.c due to a
more efficient algorithm.  Plus readability is much better too.

 Inspiration for this program came from the hardlink.c code. I liked what it
 did but did not like the code itself, to me it was very unmaintainable.  So I
 rewrote in C++ and then I rewrote it in python.  In reality this code is
 nothing like the original hardlink.c, since I do things quite differently.
 Even though this code is written in python the performance of the python
 version is much faster than the hardlink.c code, in my limited testing.  This
 is mainly due to use of different algorithms.
